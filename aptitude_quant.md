# TLDR; Don't use formulae ;)

## Day 1, Ratios

Don't make it a simultaneous equation, just start with assumptions using the ratio `A/B = 3/2` 
inferences, A is a multiple of 3, B of 2 and A+B a multiple of 3+2 :D  

Taking a unitary method style,e.g. five yrs ago, keep adding 5 until you get the next equation, `3+5 / 2 + 5` -> and check if it is a multiple of 

Option substitution, put a multiple of ten, five;calculator not allowed so make them simple calculations.

Another way, `A/B=11/4` & `A-15/B-15=8/1` so 15 years has a wieghtage of `11-3`, `4-1` so `15yrs is corresponding to 3` so `5yrs is 1 multiple` so `A=11x5=55yrs B=4x5=20yrs`

*Q. What if increase and decrease in numerator and denominator is not the same?*

*E.g. `A:B = 30:1, A+50:B+5 = 25:1` find B*
Options 12,15,20,23

Option substitution(try 20 & 15), or differences method below\/

Addition of 50 above, and 5 below

If I add 5 to B, while maintaining the ratio `A/B=30/1` so `A/B=180/6` i.e. if I add 5 to B, I need to add 150 to A, maintain the ratio: `?/5=30/1` -> `150/5` BUT WE ADD ONLY 50 to A, so 100 students missing!

Initialy A was a multiple of 30, now it is 25
Only A has decreased by five multiples
`30x - 25x = 150 - 50` -> `5x = 100` -> `x = 20`
so the multiples are `x` like `25x/1x = 500/20`
Thus new no. of B is 20 :D (since B is 1) so original before adding 5 is 15

*E.g. A father is 3x **more than** son's age and after 8 years... 
i.e. `F:S=4:1, F+8:S+8=2.5:1, F+16:S+16=?:1`*
Options 4,5,2,3,None

Note: `3 times more` is `4:1`and `3 times` is `3:1` like *8 is 3x more than 2*

Answer has to be `< 2.5`(but NOTA exists, so we need to cross check)

Solve this without equations?
**Use Factors/Multiples**
Inferences: 
*`F` is a multiple of `4`, 
`F+8` should become a multiple of `2.5`, 
since F and 8 are multiples of `4`, 
`~(F+8)~` is a multiple of `4`, 
so in `2.5(S+8)` since `8` is a multiple of `4`, `2.5`S should be a multiple of `4`
`5S/2 = 4x`
SO `S` is a multiple of `8`
`if S=8, F=4x8=32`
`F+8/S+8 = 40 / 16 = 2.5/1`
`F+16/S+16 = 48 / 24 = 2/1`*

*E.g. X says to Y: "I am twice as old as you were when I was as old as you are"
Sum of our present age is 63, find X*

so `X+Y=63, X=63-Y, Y=63-X`

I am twice `X = 2 ( OLD_Y )` -> (i)
You were when I was as old as you (`Y`)
You were when I was `Y`
So how many years back? `X - Y yrs back`

so `OLD_Y = Y - (X-Y)`

Equation (i) is now `X = 2( Y - X + Y )`
Now solve this by putting Y = 63-X :D

Other method: substitute answers like so:
