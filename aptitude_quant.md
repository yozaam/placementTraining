# TLDR; Don't use formulae ;)

## Day 1, Ratios

Don't make it a simultaneous equation,  
just start with assumptions using the ratio `A/B = 3/2`   
inferences, A is a multiple of 3, B of 2 and A+B a multiple of 3+2 :D    

Taking a unitary method style,e.g. five yrs ago, keep adding 5 until you get the next equation, `3+5 / 2 + 5` -> and check if it is a multiple of   

Option substitution, put a multiple of ten, five;calculator not allowed so make them simple calculations.  

Another way, 
`A/B=11/4` & `A-15/B-15=8/1`  
so 15 years has a wieghtage of `11-3`,  
`4-1` so `15yrs is corresponding to 3`  
so `5yrs is 1 multiple`  
so `A=11x5=55yrs B=4x5=20yrs`  

*Q. What if increase and decrease in numerator and denominator is not the same?*

*E.g. `A:B = 30:1, A+50:B+5 = 25:1` find B*  
Options 12,15,20,23

Option substitution(try 20 & 15), or differences method below\/

Addition of 50 above, and 5 below

If I add 5 to B, while maintaining the ratio `A/B=30/1` so `A/B=180/6`   
i.e. if I add 5 to B, I need to add 150 to A,  
maintain the ratio: `?/5=30/1` -> `150/5`  
BUT WE ADD ONLY 50 to A, so 100 students missing!  

Initialy A was a multiple of 30, now it is 25
Only A has decreased by five multiples  
`30x - 25x = 150 - 50` -> `5x = 100` -> `x = 20`  
so the multiples are `x` like `25x/1x = 500/20`  
Thus new no. of B is 20 :D (since B is 1) so original before adding 5 is 15  

*E.g. A father is 3x **more than** son's age and after 8 years...   
i.e. `F:S=4:1, F+8:S+8=2.5:1, F+16:S+16=?:1`*  
Options 4,5,2,3,None  

Note: `3 times more` is `4:1`and `3 times` is `3:1` like *8 is 3x more than 2*  

Answer has to be `< 2.5`(but NOTA exists, so we need to cross check)  

Solve this without equations?  
**Use Factors/Multiples**  
Inferences:   
*`F` is a multiple of `4`,   
`F+8` should become a multiple of `2.5`,   
since F and 8 are multiples of `4`,   
`~(F+8)~` is a multiple of `4`,   
so in `2.5(S+8)` since `8` is a multiple of `4`, `2.5`S should be a multiple of `4`  
`5S/2 = 4x`  
SO `S` is a multiple of `8`  
`if S=8, F=4x8=32`  
`F+8/S+8 = 40 / 16 = 2.5/1`  
`F+16/S+16 = 48 / 24 = 2/1`*  

*E.g. X says to Y: "I am twice as old as you were when I was as old as you are"  
Sum of our present age is 63, find X*  

so `X+Y=63, X=63-Y, Y=63-X`  

I am twice `X = 2 ( OLD_Y )` -> (i)  
You were when I was as old as you (`Y`)  
You were when I was `Y`  
So how many years back? `X - Y yrs back`  

so `OLD_Y = Y - (X-Y)`  

Equation (i) is now `X = 2( 2Y - X )`  
Now solve this by putting `Y = 63-X` :D  

Other method: substitute answers   
let `x = 36`, so `y = 27`  
`x = 2 (old_y)`  
when x was 27  
so `36-27=9` years back  
so `old_y =27-9=18`  
`36 = 2x18 is true`  

## Day 2, Ratios

E.g. `A = B + 500`,  
`BoysA:GirlsA=3:2`,`BoysB:GirlsB=4:1`,  
`ScienceA:HumanA:CommerceA=2:5:3`,    
`ScienceB:HumanB:CommerceB=2:3:3`,  
`CommerseA == CommerceB` i.e. same no. of commerce students  
Find: A, GirlsA+GirlsB  

Inferences:
-> from Boys:Girls A is a multiple of 5, B is a multiple of 5,
-> from Science:Human:Commerce A is a multiple of 10, B is a multiple of 8

-> So check options where A is 10x and B is 5x8x Thus `A=2500` satisfies this
-> And then check that the ratio 2:5:3 can be formed (you need â‰¥10)  
-> E.g. so `CommerceA = 3x2500/10` `B=2000 if B=8x, CommerceB=3x2000/8` both are equal so our guess is correct  

Other method, `3A/10 = 3B/8`, `4A=5B`, `A/B=5/4` 
A is a multiple of 5, B is a multiple of 4, A+B is a multiple of 9  
Find the option in which all the multiple properties are satisfied  

Other method:,` A is 10x, B is 8x ` (can't take boy girls, there they both are 5x)
difference is 500 students, 2 multiples is 500,  
1 multiple is 250 students, so `A = 10x250 and B = 8x250`

E.g. `income A:B=6:5` `expense A:B=3:2` find `savings A:B`
can assume 600/500 dif 3/2 or 12/10 dif 3/2 or 6/5 dif 3/2   
so we cannot determine what was the exact spending or expense!   
not necessary if he earns 600 he wil spend 300, he may spend 30 or 3!  
1:1 is correct but there are infinite solutions....  

E.g. Cost of stone varies directly to sqrt(wieght)  
stone broken into 1:4:4 results in an increase in profit of 12000
Find initial value    
cost = k*(sqrt(w))
```
W -> cost  
9 -> 3k so total 3k

1 -> 1k  
4 -> 2k  
4 -> 2k so total (2+2+1)k=5k  
```
`2k = 12000` so `k=6000` and `original value=3k=3x6000=18000`  

E.g. Cost of number of units is partly fixed and otherwise  
varies directly with the no. of units produced   
avg cost 15000 units is 2  
avg cost 25000 units is 1.5  
Find the variable cost per unit  

`15000 units, 30000`  
`25000 units, 37500`  
Thus extra 10000 articles is extra 7500  
1 unit is 0.75 variable cost!  
if find fixed cost look at `15000 units, fixed=30000-.75*15000 `  

E.g. 50 questions, 3mks correct, -1mk wrong,  
student attempted all, got 90, how many correct

so his correct count has to be > 30  
then i want to balance the remaining 20 questions to net score of 0  
answer is 35 , 5*3 == 15 , and -1*15 == -15 

Other method: if he got all correct, `50 correct =150mks`  
if `49 correct = 146` thus `1 wrong = net loss of -4`  
`he lost 150-90=60mks` so `1 is to -4 & 60 is to ?` so `wrong=60/4=15` :D

## Day 3 Time and Work

Q. a, b take 12, 36 days to do the work,  
*how many days will they take together?*

school method,  
`rate=w/12 + w/36 = 4w/36`  
`time=1/rate=9 days`

better method ignore variables w,  
who's more efficient? a  
in terms of quantitative difference,  
assume the work as a number divisible by all  
`let w = 36, so daily a = 3, b = 1`

sirs method,  
a alone is 12, so combined < 12 for sure!
either 9 or 10 -> 10 has a 5 as factor  
but nobody else has a 5  
substitute 9!
`so a does 9/12 of w , remaining 1/4 done by b  
b takes 36 alone, how much for 1/4 = 36/4=9`   

Q. p, q take 15, 21 days to do the work.  
p joins after q and the work is done in 14 days  
*when did p join?*
options: 8,7,6,9,12  

`let w = [l]cm(15,21) = 105`  
efficiency: `p = 7, q = 5`  
work done by q: `14q = 70`  
`remaining for p = 35`
`days for p = 35/7 = 5`  
`joining date = 14 - 5 = 9`  

sirs method,  
`q is doing 14/21 = 2/3rd of the job`  
`remaining 1/3rd , p takes 15/3 = 5`  
so he needs to join on 9th day!  

Q. a is twice as god as b, together they take 14 days,  
*how many days will a take alone*

`let w = 42`
`daily w = 3`
`a = 2, b = 1`
`a will take 42/2 = 21 days`

other method don't assume w
daily : `a = 2 , b = 1 , together = 3`  
`1 day -> 3 units,  
14 days -> 3x14 units = 42 units`

Q. m and n take 30 days  
n works for 20 days and leaves, m takes the remaining 20 days to complete the work  
n alone will take how long?

`let w = 60`  
`m+n = 2`  
`20(m + n) + 20(m) = work done in 40 days`  
`substitute m = 1, n = 1`  
`a will take 60/1 days`

Q. two pipes fill in 30, 40 mins third pipe drains in 60 *how long to full tank?*  
`let w = 120L`  
`fill = 120/30L/m + 120/40L/m - 120/60L/m =5L/m`  
`time = 120/5 m = 24`


Q. a,b fill in 20,30 mins c can drain full tank in x mins  
*all open then filled in 15 mins, what's x?*  

`let w = 60L`
`fill a+b = 60/20 L/m + 60/30 L/m = 5 L/m`
`15 mins so required = 60/15 L/m = 4L/m`
`so drain = 5-4 = 1 L/m'
`thus full drain = 1 *60 = 60 mins`

sirs method:  
`a = 15/20 = 75% `  
`b = 15/30 = 50% `  
`overflow = 25% in 15 mins, 100% in 15x4=60 mins :)`

## Day 5, Time Speed Distance

### `ST = D`  

Case: T is constant: `S is directly proportional to D`  

Case: S is constant: `T is directly proportional to D`

Case D is constant:  `S is inversely proportional to T`

### Average speed

Avg Speed of `a, b != (a + b) / 2`  
it is `total dist/ total time` (need more info ^^)

Case: T is constant: `avg = (a + b) / 2`

Case: D is constant: `avg = 2ab/(a+b)`  

### Relative speed

Case: two bodies in same direction: `rel = |s1 - s2|`

Case: two bodies in diff direction: `rel = s1 + s2` (can derive from above, `s1 - -s2` vectors on the graph are in different directions)

Time to overtake?
They are touching rn,
`((()))[[[[]]]]`
we want 
`[[[[]]]]((()))`
`distance = l1 + l2` so `time = (l1+l2)/(rel) ->(- or + from the above relative equation)`

if l2 was negligible(like a single person)

#### Streams and boats

Your effective speed is `stream + boat` or `stream - boat` if direction is same or opposite(you will go in the stronger direction) respectively

Q. if person was 3kmph faster, he would take 2 hrs less. if he was 4kmph slower he would take 5 more hrs

```
(s+3)(t-2) = (s-4)(t+5)
3t - 2s -6 = 5s - 4t - 20
7t = 7s - 14
s - t = 2 -> i
also!
st = (s+3)(t-2)
-2s + 3t = 6 -> ii
2s  - 2t = 4 -> i
_____________ -> summation
0s  + t  = 10

t = 10, s = 12, d = 120 :)
```

Q. car covers distance from town a to b at 70 kmph
b to a at 90 kmph what is the avg speed

case:avg when d is constant `avg = 2ab/(a+b)`
`avg = 12600 / 160 = 78.75`

Q. train travels with an avg speed of 60kmph without stoppages, with stoppages it travels 40kmph

Unitary method...
or Easy Formula: 
`t = 60 * (wo stoppage S  -  w stoppage S)/wo stoppage S` 
60 is for minutes -> 60 * (60-40)/(60) = 20 mins

Q. man walks at 10kmph every km he rests for 5 mins, how much time for 5km ?
```
10 km -> 60 mins
1 km -> 6 mins
```
so total time for `1 km = 6 mins + 5 mins rest = 11`

so 5km != 5 * 11 = 55 NO last km he won't take the rest!!!!!!
so 4 gaps in 5 km ;)
so 4 * 11 + 6 = 50 mins
