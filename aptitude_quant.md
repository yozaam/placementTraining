# TLDR; Don't use formulae ;)

## Day 1, Ratios

Don't make it a simultaneous equation,  
just start with assumptions using the ratio `A/B = 3/2`   
inferences, A is a multiple of 3, B of 2 and A+B a multiple of 3+2 :D    

Taking a unitary method style,e.g. five yrs ago, keep adding 5 until you get the next equation, `3+5 / 2 + 5` -> and check if it is a multiple of   

Option substitution, put a multiple of ten, five;calculator not allowed so make them simple calculations.  

Another way, 
`A/B=11/4` & `A-15/B-15=8/1`  
so 15 years has a wieghtage of `11-3`,  
`4-1` so `15yrs is corresponding to 3`  
so `5yrs is 1 multiple`  
so `A=11x5=55yrs B=4x5=20yrs`  

*Q. What if increase and decrease in numerator and denominator is not the same?*

*E.g. `A:B = 30:1, A+50:B+5 = 25:1` find B*  
Options 12,15,20,23

Option substitution(try 20 & 15), or differences method below\/

Addition of 50 above, and 5 below

If I add 5 to B, while maintaining the ratio `A/B=30/1` so `A/B=180/6`   
i.e. if I add 5 to B, I need to add 150 to A,  
maintain the ratio: `?/5=30/1` -> `150/5`  
BUT WE ADD ONLY 50 to A, so 100 students missing!  

Initialy A was a multiple of 30, now it is 25
Only A has decreased by five multiples  
`30x - 25x = 150 - 50` -> `5x = 100` -> `x = 20`  
so the multiples are `x` like `25x/1x = 500/20`  
Thus new no. of B is 20 :D (since B is 1) so original before adding 5 is 15  

*E.g. A father is 3x **more than** son's age and after 8 years...   
i.e. `F:S=4:1, F+8:S+8=2.5:1, F+16:S+16=?:1`*  
Options 4,5,2,3,None  

Note: `3 times more` is `4:1`and `3 times` is `3:1` like *8 is 3x more than 2*  

Answer has to be `< 2.5`(but NOTA exists, so we need to cross check)  

Solve this without equations?  
**Use Factors/Multiples**  
Inferences:   
*`F` is a multiple of `4`,   
`F+8` should become a multiple of `2.5`,   
since F and 8 are multiples of `4`,   
`~(F+8)~` is a multiple of `4`,   
so in `2.5(S+8)` since `8` is a multiple of `4`, `2.5`S should be a multiple of `4`  
`5S/2 = 4x`  
SO `S` is a multiple of `8`  
`if S=8, F=4x8=32`  
`F+8/S+8 = 40 / 16 = 2.5/1`  
`F+16/S+16 = 48 / 24 = 2/1`*  

*E.g. X says to Y: "I am twice as old as you were when I was as old as you are"  
Sum of our present age is 63, find X*  

so `X+Y=63, X=63-Y, Y=63-X`  

I am twice `X = 2 ( OLD_Y )` -> (i)  
You were when I was as old as you (`Y`)  
You were when I was `Y`  
So how many years back? `X - Y yrs back`  

so `OLD_Y = Y - (X-Y)`  

Equation (i) is now `X = 2( 2Y - X )`  
Now solve this by putting `Y = 63-X` :D  

Other method: substitute answers   
let `x = 36`, so `y = 27`  
`x = 2 (old_y)`  
when x was 27  
so `36-27=9` years back  
so `old_y =27-9=18`  
`36 = 2x18 is true`  

## Day 2, Ratios

E.g. `A = B + 500`,  
`BoysA:GirlsA=3:2`,`BoysB:GirlsB=4:1`,  
`ScienceA:HumanA:CommerceA=2:5:3`,    
`ScienceB:HumanB:CommerceB=2:3:3`,  
`CommerseA == CommerceB` i.e. same no. of commerce students  
Find: A, GirlsA+GirlsB  

Inferences:
-> from Boys:Girls A is a multiple of 5, B is a multiple of 5,
-> from Science:Human:Commerce A is a multiple of 10, B is a multiple of 8

-> So check options where A is 10x and B is 5x8x Thus `A=2500` satisfies this
-> And then check that the ratio 2:5:3 can be formed (you need â‰¥10)  
-> E.g. so `CommerceA = 3x2500/10` `B=2000 if B=8x, CommerceB=3x2000/8` both are equal so our guess is correct  

Other method, `3A/10 = 3B/8`, `4A=5B`, `A/B=5/4` 
A is a multiple of 5, B is a multiple of 4, A+B is a multiple of 9  
Find the option in which all the multiple properties are satisfied  

Other method:,` A is 10x, B is 8x ` (can't take boy girls, there they both are 5x)
difference is 500 students, 2 multiples is 500,  
1 multiple is 250 students, so `A = 10x250 and B = 8x250`

E.g. `income A:B=6:5` `expense A:B=3:2` find `savings A:B`
can assume 600/500 dif 3/2 or 12/10 dif 3/2 or 6/5 dif 3/2   
so we cannot determine what was the exact spending or expense!   
not necessary if he earns 600 he wil spend 300, he may spend 30 or 3!  
1:1 is correct but there are infinite solutions....  

E.g. Cost of stone varies directly to sqrt(wieght)  
stone broken into 1:4:4 results in an increase in profit of 12000
Find initial value    
cost = k*(sqrt(w))
```
W -> cost  
9 -> 3k so total 3k

1 -> 1k  
4 -> 2k  
4 -> 2k so total (2+2+1)k=5k  
```
`2k = 12000` so `k=6000` and `original value=3k=3x6000=18000`  

E.g. Cost of number of units is partly fixed and otherwise  
varies directly with the no. of units produced   
avg cost 15000 units is 2  
avg cost 25000 units is 1.5  
Find the variable cost per unit  

`15000 units, 30000`  
`25000 units, 37500`  
Thus extra 10000 articles is extra 7500  
1 unit is 0.75 variable cost!  
if find fixed cost look at `15000 units, fixed=30000-.75*15000 `  

E.g. 50 questions, 3mks correct, -1mk wrong,  
student attempted all, got 90, how many correct

so his correct count has to be > 30  
then i want to balance the remaining 20 questions to net score of 0  
answer is 35 , 5*3 == 15 , and -1*15 == -15 

Other method: if he got all correct, `50 correct =150mks`  
if `49 correct = 146` thus `1 wrong = net loss of -4`  
`he lost 150-90=60mks` so `1 is to -4 & 60 is to ?` so `wrong=60/4=15` :D
